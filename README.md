# Patient_Diagnostics_and_Trends

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a synthetic healthcare dataset to provide insights into patient demographics, diagnosis trends, and clinic utilization. The insights gathered here could assist clinic administrators in resource allocation and patient outreach programs.

## Key Findings: Patient Profile & Diagnosis Trends
Based on the analysis of 200 patient visits, the following clinical and demographic trends were identified:
* Dominant Patient Demographic: The clinic primarily serves the "Middle-Aged" (40–64) population, which accounts for nearly 48% of the unique patient base. 
* Hypertension is the Leading Condition: Chronic conditions dominate the diagnosis list. Essential Hypertension (ICD I10) is the #1 diagnosis overall, appearing in nearly 10% of all visits.
* Age-Specific Health Trends: * Younger Adults (18–39): Showing higher trends in mental health-related visits (Depression/Anxiety). Older Adults (65+): Show a high concentration of cardiovascular issues (Hypertension, Heart Disease, and Heart Failure).

## Data Source
The analysis is based on a primary dataset: patient_visits.csv.  
Demographics: Age and Sex  
Clinical Data: Visit IDs, Patient IDs, ICD-10 Diagnosis Codes, and CPT Procedure Codes  

## Tech Stack & Methodology
Excel: Data validation and formula-based age grouping.  
SQL: Aggregation of diagnostic events and utilization metrics.  
Tableau: Interactive dashboard creation with Top 10 Context Filters.
